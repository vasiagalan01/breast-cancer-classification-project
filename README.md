## 🩺 Breast Cancer Classification – Machine Learning Project
This is my third project developed as part of the Big Blue Data Academy Data Science Bootcamp. 

In this project me and my team developed built a machine learning model that classifies breast tumors as:

Malignant (M) – cancerous<br>
Benign (B) – non-cancerous

The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset, which contains 569 samples with 30 numerical features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.

🎯 Objective: Develop a reliable classification model with high sensitivity to detect malignant tumors.

Team members: 

**Vassia Galanopoulou**<br>
**Aggeliki Triantafyllou**<br>
**Vasiliki Nterkou**<br>

💡 Features describe characteristics of tumors such as: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, concavity, symmetry, fractal dimension
